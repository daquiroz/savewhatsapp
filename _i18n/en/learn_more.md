### **WhatsApp is under attack.**
Time is running out for Mark Zuckerberg to reverse his decision to change WhatsApp’s privacy policy and empower all users to protect their personal data.

### **Mark Zuckerberg made a promise.**
When Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014, Zuckerberg said: “We are absolutely not going to change plans around WhatsApp and the way it uses user data. WhatsApp is going to operate completely autonomously.”

### **Mark Zuckerberg broke that promise.**
With an update to WhatsApp’s terms and conditions in 2016, Facebook gave itself access to a wide range of your personal data.

### **Now, Facebook wants to take even more.**
The new privacy policy, coming into effect on 15 May, will give Facebook even more power to extract money from WhatsApp communications.

We are citizens, activists, lawmakers, and WhatsApp users around the world, and we are organizing to reclaim our privacy, reject the policy, and raise our voices to say:
### **Stop Facebook. Save WhatsApp.**
