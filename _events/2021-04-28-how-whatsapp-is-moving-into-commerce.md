  After being sold to Facebook with a $19 billion price tag in 2014, it’s
  finally time for WhatsApp’s 2 billion users to “pull their weight” when it
  comes to contributing to Facebook’s ever-growing revenues.\




  WhatsApp Business was launched in January 2018. It is Facebook’s revenue-generating enterprise product as well as the first instance of Facebook extracting money directly from WhatsApp. WhatsApp plans to offer more in-app shopping features and hosting services from Facebook to allow smaller companies to upgrade their mobile marketing and e-commerce efforts.\




  On May 15, WhatsApp will implement a new privacy update. This update was initially meant to come into effect February 8. Yet a popular outcry, due to concerns around data sharing between Facebook and WhatsApp, led Facebook to push the date to May 15. Facebook has spent the months since the January announcement of the update downplaying the significance of these privacy updates by arguing that its latest changes will affect only communication with business accounts.\




  Facebook hopes to see users “opt-in” to a chat-like interaction with businesses. A major push behind these interactions would be the data that Facebook has collected on users through both their Facebook and WhatsApp accounts (metadata) for the past years, unbeknownst to many users, in order to better target them with relevant advertisings that might push them to engage in such exchanges.\




  This webinar explores how the world’s largest messaging app is set to generate a new ecosystem based on WhatsApp commerce. The panelists will share their insights about the evolving business model of WhatsApp, followed by a Q&A session.\




  Join us for this thought-provoking webinar to learn all about WhatsApp Business and what the implications of this enterprise will be in the future for both business and WhatsApp user’s privacy.
